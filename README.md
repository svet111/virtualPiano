# virtualPiano

One of the many things that a front-end developer has to take care of is binding the functionality of a web application to the keys on the keyboard. In order to develop and strengthen the important skills of working with keyboard keys, we will make a virtual piano in this project.

 Virtual Piano is a graduate project.
 
It contains core topics for track Frontend Core. Apply core topics in project stages. Solve at least one graduate project to complete the track.
